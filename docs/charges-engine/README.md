# Charges Engine — Start Here

**Purpose of this file:** the single entry point. If you are resuming this work — new session, new person, lost context — read this first and trust nothing about the codebase that is not stated here or verified from the code.

**Last verified against the repository:** 2026-09-06, branch `feature/charges-engine`, Chunk 3 part 2. Full suite green: 407 tests, unit and integration.

## 2. What actually exists in code right now

**This list is exhaustive.** Everything else in this documentation is *design*, not code.

### Written by this feature (commit `67ec107`)

14 enums in `backend/src/main/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/brokercharges/dto/enums/`:

```
AggregatorType      ChargeCategory      ChargeSide        PlanType
AmountBasis         ChargeEvent         DedupeScope       RoundingPolicy
ChargeBasis         ChargeResolution    FundCategory      SlabBandBasis
                    ChargeRuleSource                      TradeSegment
```

Plus documentation: this file and the five listed in §3.

### Landed on `master` via PR #60 (D10 — a defect found while designing this)

The DP dedupe query omitted `accountHolder`, so a user tracking more than one account holder was charged once for what were two separate demat debits. Fixed in the **existing** implementation rather than waiting for Phase C, because users were being undercharged now. `BrokerChargeContext` and `UserBrokerCharges` gained `accountHolder`; the dedupe query became an `exists` returning `boolean`; AMC entries pass `dematAccountId`.

### Landed on `master` via PR #59 (test framework hardening)

- `backend/src/test/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/testsupport/MoneyAssert.java` — `assertMoney`, `assertNoCharge`, `assertBreakdown`
- `backend/src/test/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/architecture/` — `ArchitectureTest` (8 ArchUnit rules) + `SnakeCaseFieldCondition`
- `backend/src/test/resources/junit-platform.properties` — parallel execution config
- `AbstractIntegrationTest` — `@Tag("integration")`, `@Isolated`, dynamic `cleanDatabase()`
- Root `pom.xml` — JaCoCo 0.8.14, `-Punit` / `-Pintegration` / `-Pmutation` profiles, `maven.test.failure.ignore` defaulting to `false`
- `.github/workflows/cicd.yaml` — spotless folded into the main invocation, minimum-report gate, `jacoco.xml` artifact

Eight entities in `entity/`: `ChargeSlab`, `ChargeRule`, `ChargeLine`, `ChargeScheduleEntity`, `ChargeInstrumentEntity`, `UserChargeEntity`, `ChargeCatalogueEntity`, `ChargeAccountEntity`.

Five repositories in `repository/`: `ChargeScheduleRepository`, `ChargeInstrumentRepository`, `UserChargeRepository`, `ChargeCatalogueRepository`, `ChargeAccountRepository`.

`config/ChargeIndexInitializer` — creates the declared indexes, because `auto-index-creation` is off application-wide and the annotations would otherwise create nothing.

`ChargeRepositoryIntegrationTest` — 14 tests proving the documents map and the queries execute.

### Written by Chunk 3 (commits `d13281f` and the one after it)

In `brokercharges/engine/`: `ChargeRounding`, `ChargeAccumulator`, `ChargeFormulaEvaluator`, `ChargeCalculator`, `ChargeCalculatorRegistry`. In `dto/context/`: `ChargeContext`, `ChargeComputation`, `LotSlice`.

Tests: `ChargeRoundingTest` (20), `ChargeAccumulatorTest` (9), `ChargeFormulaEvaluatorTest` (15), `ChargeCalculatorRegistryTest` (6), `ApplicationContextIntegrationTest` (1).

### NOT written yet — do not assume any of it exists

No service, controller or seed data has been written, and the orchestrator is still outstanding. Specifically absent: `ChargeEngine`, every `*Calculator` implementation, `ChargeScheduleResolver`, `ChargeInstrumentResolver`, `ChargeScheduleValidator`, `ChargeScheduleService`, `ChargeSeederService`, `UserChargeService`, `AmcChargeService`, every controller, and everything under `resources/data/charges/`.

### The old implementation is fully intact and untouched

13 files under `brokercharges/` still implement the superseded design: `BrokerCharges`, `UserBrokerCharges`, `BrokerChargeService`, `UserBrokerChargeService`, both repositories, both controllers, `BrokerChargeContext`, `BrokerChargesRequest`, `BrokerageChargesDto`, `AssetManagementDetailsRequest`, `package-info`. Three old enums also remain: `AmcChargeFrequency`, `BrokerChargeTransactionType`, `BrokerageAggregatorType`.

**It is deleted in Phase C, not before.** Nothing in `portfolio/` has been modified, and that is a hard rule for Phase A (§5).

## 3. Document map

Read in this order:

| # | Document | What it answers | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **README.md** *(this file)* | Where things stand; how to resume | 171 |
| 2 | **decisions.md** | *Why* the design is the way it is. 22 decisions, each with context, rationale and consequences | 260 |
| 3 | **prd.md** | Requirements, 9 catalogued defects in the old code, 12 acceptance criteria | 187 |
| 4 | **tech-spec.md** | The design. Entities, engine contracts, algorithms, seed format, extensibility analysis (§13), temporal semantics (§14) | 912 |
| 5 | **test-plan.md** | How it is verified. ~190 tests across 11 tiers, with gates | 347 |
| 6 | **implementation-checklist.md** | The build tracker. Resume from the first unticked box | 339 |

**If you change the design, update `decisions.md` and `tech-spec.md` together.** A decision recorded in only one of them will be lost.

## 4. The problem, in one paragraph

The existing broker-charges implementation models a rate card as a **fixed set of Java fields** — one named column per charge, repeated across `BrokerCharges`, `UserBrokerCharges` and `BrokerChargesReport`. Adding one charge is an eight-file change across two modules. There is no asset-type dimension, so `ProfitAndLossService` gates on `assetType == EQUITY` and mutual funds, bonds and gold bonds accrue nothing. GST is parsed from a CSV string and applied over a merged `govtCharges` bucket that includes STT and stamp duty, which is wrong — roughly ₹17 of overcharge on a ₹1,00,000 sell. The replacement makes a rate card a **list of rules**, evaluated by **strategies chosen per basis**, so that adding or repricing a charge is a data change.

---

## 5. The three phases

| Phase | Scope | Touches `portfolio`? |
|---|---|---|
| **A** *(current)* | Standalone engine: schedules, instruments, rules, calculators, seeds, simulate API | **No.** Hard rule. |
| **B** | Shadow: engine computes and persists alongside the live flow, result ignored; reconciliation report | One interface + injection |
| **C** | Cutover: computed total drives cost basis, manual charge entry retired, old code deleted | Yes |

**Phase A exit criterion, checked literally:**
```bash
git diff master --stat -- backend/src/main/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/portfolio/
```
must be **empty**. If it is not, scope has leaked and the cutover is no longer reversible.

---

## 6. How to resume

```bash
git checkout feature/charges-engine
git log --oneline master..HEAD          # what has been committed on this branch
./mvnw test -pl backend -am -Punit      # ~161 tests, ~7s, no Docker — confirms the framework works
```

Then open `implementation-checklist.md` and start at the first unticked box.

**Working agreement, as instructed by the repository owner:**
- **Test-driven.** Write the failing test first, watch it fail, then implement until it passes. Not tests-alongside, and not tests-afterwards. In Java the first red is usually a compile error, which proves nothing — create minimal skeletons so the test compiles, then show real assertion failures before implementing. Pure data carriers with no branch or calculation have no behaviour to drive out and are exempt.
- Stop for review **after each chunk**.
- **One commit per chunk**, local to this branch; not pushed until asked.
- Build quality-first — no compromises taken for speed.

---

## 7. Settled decisions (do not re-litigate)

Full rationale in `decisions.md`. Summary:

| Topic | Settled as |
|---|---|
| Broker seed cards | **Zerodha only** in Phase A |
| Schedules to seed | **Three**: EQUITY/DELIVERY, EQUITY/INTRADAY, MUTUAL_FUND |
| Rate values | **Placeholders**, `verifiedOn: null`, marked `PLACEHOLDER`. Consequence: **AC-2 is blocked** until real rates arrive |
| F&O | Model-only. `amountBasis`, `lotSize`, `orderId` carried; no seed cards |
| Manual charge entry | The engine replaces it — that is the point of the work |
| Module rename `brokercharges` → `charges` | Deferred to Phase C |
| `planCode` dimension | Exists on the schedule; not populated in Phase A |
| AMC accounts | New `ChargeAccountEntity`; `AssetManagementDetails` untouched until Phase C |
| Upload model | **Quarterly batches, chronological** — with a guard, because the guarantee is operational not enforced |

## 8. Facts that are easy to get wrong

Each of these was established by investigation or corrected after being got wrong once. Re-deriving them incorrectly will produce broken work.

1. **`FormulaEvaluator` in `taxplanning` must not be reused.** The charges module owns `ChargeFormulaEvaluator` outright. The two solve a similar problem; neither depends on the other. Returns `double` (money, two decimals), not `long` (whole rupees).

2. **Superseding a rate card must never set `status`.** It closes `endDate` only. The resolver filters `status != INACTIVE`, *not* `status == ACTIVE`. Otherwise a 2024 transaction uploaded in 2026 finds no card and silently computes zero. See `decisions.md` ADR-12.

3. **Exit load is per FIFO lot**, not per transaction. Averaging can be wrong by the entire charge, not a rounding error.

4. **GST base must be declared explicitly.** It never includes STT or stamp duty. This is the D1 defect and has a dedicated golden fixture.

5. **Engine arithmetic is `BigDecimal` internally**, `double` only at the persistence boundary. Otherwise golden tests go flaky and tolerances creep.

6. **Surefire's exit code is trustworthy now** (PR #59), but CI passes `-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true` on its own invocation. Locally, a failing test fails the build.

7. **`AbstractIntegrationTest` is `@Isolated` and must stay so.** RestAssured's `baseURI`/`port` are static globals and all integration classes share one Mongo container.

8. **New collections must be nothing.** `cleanDatabase()` now enumerates collections dynamically against a seeded whitelist, so new charge collections need no change to it — but if a new collection must *survive* between tests, it has to be added to `SEEDED_REFERENCE_COLLECTIONS`.

9. **`portfolio` already produces FIFO lots.** `PortfolioService.updateQuantityBySavingReportAndProfitAndLoss1` builds `List<BuyContext>` (quantity, date, price). Phase C consumes it; Phase A supplies lots through the simulate endpoint instead.

10. **`ChargeCalculatorRegistry` is deliberately not a `@Component`.** Its constructor refuses to build unless every `ChargeBasis` is served, so annotating it before the Chunk 4 calculators exist takes the whole application down at startup. The annotation goes on when the last basis is served. Do not add it back early — it was added once, and nothing caught it because unit tests construct the registry directly.

11. **`AssetEntity` has no ISIN or scheme code** — only `stockCode` and `stockName`. `ChargeInstrumentEntity` is keyed on `stockCode` for that reason, with `isin` stored for later.

## 9. Open items

Everything design-level is settled. Two remain open, neither blocking Chunk 2.

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **AC-2 cannot be closed in Phase A** — golden fixtures assert against placeholder rates, so they pin the arithmetic but not reality | Decided (ADR-18). Needs real Zerodha rates, then one re-verification |
| 2 | **`ChargeAccountEntity` shape** — AMC billing cycles, `lastBilledThrough`, multiple demat accounts per broker (`AssetManagementDetails` carries `dematAccountId`) | Designed, not yet reviewed. Lands in Chunk 2 |
| 3 | **`charge_catalogue` initial code list** — the registry of valid charge codes | Drafted in tech-spec §7. Confirm the list when Chunk 6 seeds it |
| 4 | ~~Missing instrument profile: error or warning?~~ | **Settled — ADR-24.** Recorded, never fatal. Gated by `requiresInstrumentProfile`; validator checks expression variables against an allow-list |
| 5 | ~~Does `AccountType` affect charges?~~ | **Settled — ADR-25.** No rate impact, but `accountHolder` joins every dedupe key. Uncovered defect D10: DP charges are undercounted across account holders |
| 6 | **`exchangeName` is `"NSE"` everywhere in tests and the API collection** — plain uppercase codes, so the schedule's `exchange` dimension matches directly. BSE is untested | Low risk, noted |

### Verified non-issues

- **Corporate actions** — closed as ADR-23. Exempt by default, with per-rule opt-in for buybacks and rights.

---

## 10. Known limits, stated deliberately

Not oversights — decisions with reasons, recorded so nobody rediscovers them as bugs.

| Limit | Why it is out of scope |
|---|---|
| **MTF interest** accrues daily on an open position, not at a trade event | Needs a cycle runner like AMC, a second execution mode |
| **Aggregate caps** ("max ₹X brokerage per day across all trades") | `DedupeScope` charges *once*; it cannot cap a *sum* |
| **Volume-tiered pricing** on cumulative monthly turnover | Needs historical aggregation before the current trade can be priced |
| **Seeded rates are placeholders** | Only a human comparing against the broker's live charges page can close AC-2 |
| **Performance under load** | Resolver cache is asserted for correctness, not latency |

---

## 11. Resume point — Chunk 3 complete bar the orchestrator

**Paused:** 2026-09-06. Build green: **407 tests** (unit + integration, Docker up), `spotless:check` clean.

### Committed

- `d13281f` — `ChargeRounding`, `ChargeAccumulator`, `ChargeFormulaEvaluator`, plus `ChargeContext`, `ChargeComputation` and `LotSlice` (Chunk 3, part 1)
- *this commit* — `ChargeCalculator`, `ChargeCalculatorRegistry`, `ChargeCalculatorRegistryTest`, `ApplicationContextIntegrationTest` (Chunk 3, part 2)

Nothing is left uncommitted. The registry was reviewed before it went in, and the review found a
real defect — see below.

### What the review caught

`ChargeCalculatorRegistry` was annotated `@Component`. Its constructor refuses to build unless every
`ChargeBasis` is served, and the calculators are Chunk 4 — so the application could not start, and
every integration test would have failed the moment Docker came back. All 213 unit tests were green
throughout, because they construct the registry directly.

The gap was that **nothing asserted the application starts**. `ApplicationContextIntegrationTest`
now does, and it was written first: red against the real Spring Boot context with the exact
`IllegalStateException`, green once the annotation came off. That test is the lasting part of this
fix — the annotation would have been re-added eventually by someone wiring Chunk 4, and now the
build says so immediately.

Recorded as §8 fact 10 so the annotation is not restored early.

### Then: `ChargeEngine`

The only thing left in Chunk 3. Test-first, per the working agreement in §6. The contract is
tech-spec §5.4 (resolve → filter → sort → dispatch → modifiers → assemble) and §5.5 (modifier order:
aggregator, then min/max, then rounding — applied by the engine, never inside a calculator). Test
cases are test-plan Tier B, roughly 30 of them.

Everything the engine needs now exists apart from the calculators themselves, which are Chunk 4.
Engine tests stub `ChargeCalculator`, exactly as `ChargeCalculatorRegistryTest` already does.

### What TDD has caught so far, worth continuing for

1. `#charges['CODE']` threw `EL1027E` — SpEL indexes `Map`, and the lookup was backed by a record. Implementation-first, this would have surfaced later inside the engine with a murkier trace.
2. `20.00 * 0.18` returned `3.5999999999999996`. The failing assertion turned out to be the *test's* error: ADR-15 settles that rounding happens once in the orchestrator, so an unrounded return is correct. A test written afterwards would have been shaped to whatever the code did.
3. The `@Component` above. Applying test-first to the *integration* tier, not just units, is what turned "the app is broken and no test knows" into a two-minute red-green.
