# Charges Engine — Start Here

**Purpose of this file:** the single entry point. If you are resuming this work — new session, new person, lost context — read this first and trust nothing about the codebase that is not stated here or verified from the code.

**Last verified against the repository:** 2026-09-05, branch `feature/charges-engine` at commit `67ec107`.

## 2. What actually exists in code right now

**This list is exhaustive.** Everything else in this documentation is *design*, not code.

### Written by this feature (commit `67ec107`)

14 enums in `backend/src/main/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/brokercharges/dto/enums/`:

```
AggregatorType      ChargeCategory      ChargeSide        PlanType
AmountBasis         ChargeEvent         DedupeScope       RoundingPolicy
ChargeBasis         ChargeResolution    FundCategory      SlabBandBasis
                    ChargeRuleSource                      TradeSegment
```

Plus documentation: this file and the five listed in §3.

### Landed earlier, on `master` via PR #59 (test framework hardening)

- `backend/src/test/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/testsupport/MoneyAssert.java` — `assertMoney`, `assertNoCharge`, `assertBreakdown`
- `backend/src/test/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/architecture/` — `ArchitectureTest` (8 ArchUnit rules) + `SnakeCaseFieldCondition`
- `backend/src/test/resources/junit-platform.properties` — parallel execution config
- `AbstractIntegrationTest` — `@Tag("integration")`, `@Isolated`, dynamic `cleanDatabase()`
- Root `pom.xml` — JaCoCo 0.8.14, `-Punit` / `-Pintegration` / `-Pmutation` profiles, `maven.test.failure.ignore` defaulting to `false`
- `.github/workflows/cicd.yaml` — spotless folded into the main invocation, minimum-report gate, `jacoco.xml` artifact

### NOT written yet — do not assume any of it exists

No entity, repository, service, engine, calculator, controller, seed JSON or test belonging to the charges engine has been written. Specifically absent: `ChargeScheduleEntity`, `ChargeRule`, `ChargeSlab`, `ChargeLine`, `UserChargeEntity`, `ChargeCatalogueEntity`, `ChargeInstrumentEntity`, `ChargeAccountEntity`, `ChargeEngine`, every `*Calculator`, `ChargeFormulaEvaluator`, `ChargeScheduleResolver`, `ChargeScheduleValidator`, `ChargeSeederService`, `UserChargeService`, and everything under `resources/data/charges/`.

### The old implementation is fully intact and untouched

13 files under `brokercharges/` still implement the superseded design: `BrokerCharges`, `UserBrokerCharges`, `BrokerChargeService`, `UserBrokerChargeService`, both repositories, both controllers, `BrokerChargeContext`, `BrokerChargesRequest`, `BrokerageChargesDto`, `AssetManagementDetailsRequest`, `package-info`. Three old enums also remain: `AmcChargeFrequency`, `BrokerChargeTransactionType`, `BrokerageAggregatorType`.

**It is deleted in Phase C, not before.** Nothing in `portfolio/` has been modified, and that is a hard rule for Phase A (§5).

## 3. Document map

Read in this order:

| # | Document | What it answers | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **README.md** *(this file)* | Where things stand; how to resume | 171 |
| 2 | **decisions.md** | *Why* the design is the way it is. 22 decisions, each with context, rationale and consequences | 260 |
| 3 | **prd.md** | Requirements, 9 catalogued defects in the old code, 12 acceptance criteria | 187 |
| 4 | **tech-spec.md** | The design. Entities, engine contracts, algorithms, seed format, extensibility analysis (§13), temporal semantics (§14) | 912 |
| 5 | **test-plan.md** | How it is verified. ~190 tests across 11 tiers, with gates | 347 |
| 6 | **implementation-checklist.md** | The build tracker. Resume from the first unticked box | 339 |
| — | `../testing/test-framework-audit.md` | The framework work that preceded this, and why | 221 |

**If you change the design, update `decisions.md` and `tech-spec.md` together.** A decision recorded in only one of them will be lost.

## 4. The problem, in one paragraph

The existing broker-charges implementation models a rate card as a **fixed set of Java fields** — one named column per charge, repeated across `BrokerCharges`, `UserBrokerCharges` and `BrokerChargesReport`. Adding one charge is an eight-file change across two modules. There is no asset-type dimension, so `ProfitAndLossService` gates on `assetType == EQUITY` and mutual funds, bonds and gold bonds accrue nothing. GST is parsed from a CSV string and applied over a merged `govtCharges` bucket that includes STT and stamp duty, which is wrong — roughly ₹17 of overcharge on a ₹1,00,000 sell. The replacement makes a rate card a **list of rules**, evaluated by **strategies chosen per basis**, so that adding or repricing a charge is a data change.

---

## 5. The three phases

| Phase | Scope | Touches `portfolio`? |
|---|---|---|
| **A** *(current)* | Standalone engine: schedules, instruments, rules, calculators, seeds, simulate API | **No.** Hard rule. |
| **B** | Shadow: engine computes and persists alongside the live flow, result ignored; reconciliation report | One interface + injection |
| **C** | Cutover: computed total drives cost basis, manual charge entry retired, old code deleted | Yes |

**Phase A exit criterion, checked literally:**
```bash
git diff master --stat -- backend/src/main/java/com/thiru/wealthlens/portfolio/
```
must be **empty**. If it is not, scope has leaked and the cutover is no longer reversible.

---

## 6. How to resume

```bash
git checkout feature/charges-engine
git log --oneline master..HEAD          # what has been committed on this branch
./mvnw test -pl backend -am -Punit      # ~161 tests, ~7s, no Docker — confirms the framework works
```

Then open `implementation-checklist.md` and start at the first unticked box.

**Working agreement, as instructed by the repository owner:**
- Stop for review **after each chunk**.
- **One commit per chunk**, local to this branch; not pushed until asked.
- Build quality-first — no compromises taken for speed.

---

## 7. Settled decisions (do not re-litigate)

Full rationale in `decisions.md`. Summary:

| Topic | Settled as |
|---|---|
| Broker seed cards | **Zerodha only** in Phase A |
| Schedules to seed | **Three**: EQUITY/DELIVERY, EQUITY/INTRADAY, MUTUAL_FUND |
| Rate values | **Placeholders**, `verifiedOn: null`, marked `PLACEHOLDER`. Consequence: **AC-2 is blocked** until real rates arrive |
| F&O | Model-only. `amountBasis`, `lotSize`, `orderId` carried; no seed cards |
| Manual charge entry | The engine replaces it — that is the point of the work |
| Module rename `brokercharges` → `charges` | Deferred to Phase C |
| `planCode` dimension | Exists on the schedule; not populated in Phase A |
| AMC accounts | New `ChargeAccountEntity`; `AssetManagementDetails` untouched until Phase C |
| Upload model | **Quarterly batches, chronological** — with a guard, because the guarantee is operational not enforced |

---

## 8. Facts that are easy to get wrong

Each of these was established by investigation or corrected after being got wrong once. Re-deriving them incorrectly will produce broken work.

1. **`FormulaEvaluator` in `taxplanning` must not be reused.** The charges module owns `ChargeFormulaEvaluator` outright. The two solve a similar problem; neither depends on the other. Returns `double` (money, two decimals), not `long` (whole rupees).

2. **Superseding a rate card must never set `status`.** It closes `endDate` only. The resolver filters `status != INACTIVE`, *not* `status == ACTIVE`. Otherwise a 2024 transaction uploaded in 2026 finds no card and silently computes zero. See `decisions.md` ADR-12.

3. **Exit load is per FIFO lot**, not per transaction. Averaging can be wrong by the entire charge, not a rounding error.

4. **GST base must be declared explicitly.** It never includes STT or stamp duty. This is the D1 defect and has a dedicated golden fixture.

5. **Engine arithmetic is `BigDecimal` internally**, `double` only at the persistence boundary. Otherwise golden tests go flaky and tolerances creep.

6. **Surefire's exit code is trustworthy now** (PR #59), but CI passes `-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true` on its own invocation. Locally, a failing test fails the build.

7. **`AbstractIntegrationTest` is `@Isolated` and must stay so.** RestAssured's `baseURI`/`port` are static globals and all integration classes share one Mongo container.

8. **New collections must be nothing.** `cleanDatabase()` now enumerates collections dynamically against a seeded whitelist, so new charge collections need no change to it — but if a new collection must *survive* between tests, it has to be added to `SEEDED_REFERENCE_COLLECTIONS`.

9. **`portfolio` already produces FIFO lots.** `PortfolioService.updateQuantityBySavingReportAndProfitAndLoss1` builds `List<BuyContext>` (quantity, date, price). Phase C consumes it; Phase A supplies lots through the simulate endpoint instead.

10. **`AssetEntity` has no ISIN or scheme code** — only `stockCode` and `stockName`. `ChargeInstrumentEntity` is keyed on `stockCode` for that reason, with `isin` stored for later.

## 9. Known limits, stated deliberately

Not oversights — decisions with reasons, recorded so nobody rediscovers them as bugs.

| Limit | Why it is out of scope |
|---|---|
| **MTF interest** accrues daily on an open position, not at a trade event | Needs a cycle runner like AMC, a second execution mode |
| **Aggregate caps** ("max ₹X brokerage per day across all trades") | `DedupeScope` charges *once*; it cannot cap a *sum* |
| **Volume-tiered pricing** on cumulative monthly turnover | Needs historical aggregation before the current trade can be priced |
| **Seeded rates are placeholders** | Only a human comparing against the broker's live charges page can close AC-2 |
| **Performance under load** | Resolver cache is asserted for correctness, not latency |
